# XYZ Project Repository

This repository contains a series of files related to the XYZ project, which is a study of rain cloud analysis and experimentation. The files are organized as follows:

## Folders and Files

### `conflictsLogs`

This folder contains conflict logs generated during the project's execution. They are used to store the conflict logs detected by the approach.

### `execution-1` to `execution-10`

Each of these folders contains the results of the 10 different executions of the experiment. Each execution may contain log files, outputs, or specific results from that run.

### `sheets`

It contains spreadsheets with the time for each execution with mean, median and stardard deviation.

### `times`

In this folder, you will find files related to the runtime of different parts of the experiment. They are essential for evaluating the project's performance and efficiency. It contains spreadsheets with the time for each scenary.

### `visitedMethods`

This folder may contain information about the methods visited during the project's execution. It is useful for tracking and analysis purposes.

### `diff_files.pdf`

It generates a PDF with the differences, if they exist, for each execution.

### `rain_cloud_analysis_and_configuration_time.jpg` and `rain_cloud_analysis_and_configuration_time.pdf`

It contains a rain cloud-type chart with the execution and configuration time for each execution.

### `rain_cloud_analysis_time.jpg` and `rain_cloud_analysis_time.pdf`

It contains a rain cloud-type chart with only the execution time and without configuration for each execution.

### `rain_cloud_experiment_time.jpg` and `rain_cloud_experiment_time.pdf`

It contains a rain cloud-type chart with an overall view of the experiment, including the mean, median, and standard deviation.

### `rain_cloud_scenarios_time.jpg` and `rain_cloud_scenarios_time.pdf`

It contains a rain cloud-type chart with only the execution time and without configuration for each scenario.

### `results_by_scenario_all_execution.csv`

This CSV file contains consolidated results from all executions, organized by rain cloud scenario. It is useful for data analysis and result comparison.
